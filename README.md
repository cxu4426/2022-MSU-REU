# 2022 Research Experience for Undergraduates (Funded by the NSF)
This repo includes papers from my summer research at Montana State University.
`iETC_2023_Changepoint.pdf` was submitted to the 2023 Intermountain Engineering, Technology, and Computing Conference.
`MSU_ECE_REU_2022.pdf` is my personal paper on the research I did.

Repo with my work is pinned on my account and can also be found here: https://github.com/BMW-lab-MSU/changepoint-detection-matlab
There is also a presentation in this repo that gives an overview of what I did.
